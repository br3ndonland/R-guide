# Supplementary files

These files were originally managed with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). See the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files) for information on how Git LFS integrates with GitHub.

[GitHub Git LFS quotas](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage) were sometimes exceeded, so the files have been moved [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/HE8KGEK36G#BDZktYXUwgjT). The `.url` files each contain a link to the file that was originally stored with Git LFS.
